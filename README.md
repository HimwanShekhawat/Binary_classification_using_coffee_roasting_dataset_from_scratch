# Binary_classification_using_coffee_roasting_dataset_from_scratch
This notebook demonstrates a simple binary classification neural network using NumPy. It generates synthetic coffee roasting data, applies feature normalization, defines ReLU and Sigmoid activations, and trains a basic neural network to classify optimal roasting conditions.

## Contents
- Data generation simulating coffee roasting process
- Feature normalization
- Custom neural network implementation (NumPy)
- ReLU and Sigmoid activations
- Binary classification visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Run the notebook cell-by-cell to:
1. Generate and visualize the data.
2. Normalize features.
3. Initialize and train a neural network.
4. Visualize the classification decision.
