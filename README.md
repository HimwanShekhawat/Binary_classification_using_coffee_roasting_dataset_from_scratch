# Binary_classification_using_coffee_roasting_dataset_from_scratch
This notebook demonstrates a simple binary classification neural network using NumPy. It generates synthetic coffee roasting data, applies feature normalization, defines ReLU and Sigmoid activations, and trains a basic neural network to classify optimal roasting conditions
